Parse Client Library
---

1. Rename the app.config.sample to app.config
2. Populate the appId and masterKey from Parse

If you wish to run the test project apply the same steps to the sample app.config file in the tests project.

Compile the project and include it as a reference in your project.  This project relies on Json.NET to convert the data in and out from Parse.
